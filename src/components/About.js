            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I always thought my dream was to be a pilot for a Middle Eastern airline, flying big jets and travelling the world. 
            But everything changed the instant I finished my first page of Andreas M. Antonopoulos' "Mastering Bitcoin." 
            Since then, I've felt like I can use blockchain to make a difference in the world, so I kept learning.<br></br>
            <br></br>If you understand how it feels to be financially insecure, you would know how we can go above and beyond 
            when an opportunity arises. I am looking for a job in this industry right now. <br></br>
            I'm always up for an insightfulÂ conversation over coffee, or if you're not in Hyderabad, over Google Meet. <br></br>
            So feel free to connect, I've provided my socials below.
